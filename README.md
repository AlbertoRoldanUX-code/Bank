This project was part of the The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The aim was to get better working with arrays and be able to identify which array method to use in each occasion.

You can login writing "ar" as username and 1111 as PIN. There is another account: "jd" as username and 2222 as PIN.

It's basically an online bank interface. It shows the movements, overall balance, a summary data and there are 3 options that we can do: transfer money, request a loan or close the account.
